### Systematic Universal Security Testing Orchestration

As more security tools to secure IT systems emerge the complexity that security
teams have to face is increasing very fast.

It is crucial to shorten the window of exposure and focus efforts on bringing
the mean time to fix down. But this is not enough, what we really need is to be
sure that each countermeasure (control) we develop and deploy is working as
expected, so when a breach occurs we can focus on resolve the new threat instead
to check if any control didn't work well or was deactivated or removed.

It's not new that Aplication Security Testing Orchestration (ASTO) is a urgent
need, so security teams can analyze the results of the scans in order to detect
and react quickly, but we want to extend ASTO to allow extend the security
assurance to the whole proccess, not only th last stages.

SUSTO seeks to be the specification for a tool or set of tools that allow
security teams:

- to validate that all controls in place are working as intended in a
  systemmatic and universal manner.
- to help in the definition of new controls, together with security architects
  and application developers.
- to define and implement the tests needed to check the controls deployed
- to execute the tests in an automatic manner so they can be orchestrated to
  satisfy the 'All of' and 'none of' conditions
- to publish and share those tests so other teams work can be re-used saving
  lots of time and money
- to assure the security in all the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
