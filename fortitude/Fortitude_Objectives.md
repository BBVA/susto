## Rationale

[Operation Fortitude](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operaci%C3%B3n_Fortitude) built an army mockup to divert attention from [Operation Overlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord), our aim is not to divert from the desired features of Overlord but to try to demonstrate how it should work.

First interaction with different potential stakeholders showed their different points of view and understanding of the project goals and the difficulty to communicate how BBVA Innovation Labs foresee the whole project.

So we decided to build a mockup to detail and be able to discuss features. Th

### Efficiency

- Collaboration in the elimination of false positives through contributions from the community
- Definition of Done agreement mechanism shared with vulnerability "solvers"
- **Automation of checks that now must be manual**
- **Simple tool chaining**
- **Mapping standards using the power of Metadata and Community**
- Leveraging the Community to achieve comprehensiveness
- **Reuse of checks across projects, organizations, industries**
- **Show how Overlord can build Community: ruleset catalog mockup**
